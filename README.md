## BetterCraft
 BetterCraft is a client made by <i>nzxter</i>. It has some great features like an IRC client with access to <b>irc.libera.chat#BetterCraft</b> channel (the rights to which I violently stole), proxy support, tor engine and a bunch of server crash exploits, but not a single hack. This, ultimately, makes it just a fancy exploit toolkit.
